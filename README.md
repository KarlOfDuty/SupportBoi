# Support Boi [![Build Status](http://95.217.45.17:8080/job/SupportBoi/job/master/badge/icon)](http://95.217.45.17:8080/blue/organizations/jenkins/SupportBoi/activity) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/KarlofDuty/SupportBoi.svg)](https://github.com/KarlOfDuty/SupportBoi/releases) [![Discord Server](https://img.shields.io/discord/430468637183442945.svg?label=discord)](https://discord.gg/C5qMvkj)

A support ticket Discord bot. Uses a MySQL database for storage of ticket information. Creates amazingly formatted HTML ticket transcripts when tickets are closed. Has the ability to output ticket information to a Google sheet which can be customized in a number of ways.

There appears to be an issue where CentOS 7 may not be compatible with some element of this bot causing it to not start.

#### Thanks to [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) for the great library used in the transcript function.

## Setup

1. [Create a new bot application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).

2. [Install .NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).

3. Download the bot for your operating system, either a [release version](https://github.com/KarlOfDuty/SupportBoi/releases) or a [dev build](http://95.217.45.17:8080/blue/organizations/jenkins/SupportBoi/activity).

4. Run `./SupportBoi` on Linux or `./SupportBoi.exe` on Windows.

5. Set up the config (`config.yml`) to your specifications, there are instructions inside and also further down on this page. If you need more help either contact me in Discord or through an issue here.

#### Google Sheets integration (Optional): 
 
If you are using Google Sheets you will have to do some additional setup:

1. Generate a credentials.json file by clicking "Enable the Google Sheets API" [here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/dotnet), and following the instructions.

2. Place this file in the same directory as the bot.

3. You now need to generate a token. On a desktop PC the bot will open a browser window for you to log into your Google account and generate an API token, which is then automatically saved as "token.json" in the bot directory. I have no idea how to generate it from a terminal environment so I recommend you run the bot with the Sheets API set up once on your normal PC first and then just transfer the token it creates to your server.

4. If you did step 3 in a desktop environment you do not have to do anything else, if you did it in a terminal environment you likely have to restart the application after adding the token.
